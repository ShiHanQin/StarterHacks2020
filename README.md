# StarterHacks2020
Interview preparation application made with React Native and Google Cloud APIs 

I was in a five person group at StarterHacks and as first year students, we all found ourselves facing the same problems with securing a job. There are many resources for resume critiquing like grammar checkers or critiquing events, but once you get past that stage, there aren't many platforms that allow you to practice your interviewing skills with ease and accessibility. 

That's why we came up with the solution cali || bust. It is an app that allows a user to upload their resume so it can parse through it to pick out key words to make into customized interview questions. The user will then be able to record their attempts with answering those questions, and they'll be able to play them back to self-analyze and receive feedback. Future applications include more functionality like sentiment detection and analysis as well as more advanced feedback features in general.
